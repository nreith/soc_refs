This github repository owes a direct debt of gratitude to [Professor Kieran J. Healy](https://github.com/kjhealy/socbibs#bibtex-files-of-use-to-sociologists) Duke University. Though I have never met him, his public Sociology has offered endless inspiration for my evolution toward Sociological Geekdom.

# Summary #

BibTeX files covering Sociology, Political Sociology, Revolution, Religious and Ethnic Social Movements, Networks, Contentious Politics, Social Capital, Pro-Social Behavior, and a bunch of other things.

Here I keep files specific to certain topics or papers that I write, as well as a master .bib file containing all references cited in my work.
